# Ebay Scaping App

This app was written to scrape a set of CPU's, GPU's, and Motherboards from ebay. That is present in the ebay_app.py file. Additionally, that file has added functionality that is now deprecated to scrape benchmark data for all available CPU's and GPU's. The website used for that has changed their terms of service, so previously scraped benchmarks were saved as csv files and are currently being used. Becuase of this change, while still hosted on streamlit, the app has been made private.
